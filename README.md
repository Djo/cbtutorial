## Chicago Boss Tutorial

This is an example of simple longpolling based on [Chicago Boss](http://www.chicagoboss.org/) framework.

### How to hit the ground running

Install Erlang/OTP-R15 and [rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar) build-tool. After that:

    ./rebar get-deps
    ./rebar compile
    ./init-dev.sh

And you'll get it on localhost:8001.
